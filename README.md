# eSight

eSight is a device consisting of an AI-based camera attached to an eye spectacle. It uses computer vision algorithms to help blind people. The camera attached on the spectacles loads real-time frames and extracts the objects in those frames and those objects will be pronounced with the headset attached to the spectacles to guide the person in navigation. So while wearing eSight visually impaired people can get all the insight by the means of an artificial vision system.
